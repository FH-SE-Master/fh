\chapter{Abstract}
This thesis deals with the comparison of heuristic algorithms of classification and clustering.\\
First we discuss clustering as a part of the unsupervised classification. This is used to divide big data into smaller and different parts.
Different algorithms and Methods describe the common used strategies of clustering relatively well. Basically every data set is different and not every algorithm can be applied to it, so every method has to be customized to fit into the data set properties.\\
In contrast to the Clustering the Classification separates data sets based on predefined classes in groups by using train data and test data. 
Different algorithms are described to show a number of different methods to use classification. 
A main measurement for the algorithms is basically classification quality. 
All algorithms use predefined data to boost computing performance. That means Classification is used more often than clustering. Finally some examples and tests of the different algorithms of classification and clustering are described.\\
The HeuristicLab software is used for the calculation of the algorithms and the sample data is provided from the UCI repository. All samples show us which kind of algorithms can be used for the different data sets and the best results.
